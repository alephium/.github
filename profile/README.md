### A new paradigm

Alephium is the first operational sharded L1 blockchain scaling and enhancing PoW & UTXO concepts. Decentralization, self-sovereignty, and security meet high-performance, accessibility, and energy efficiency in a dev-friendly network optimized for DeFi & smart contract applications.

### Accessibility & Usability

From its technical design to its interfaces, Alephium has been created to address the challenges of accessibility, scalability, and security encountered by decentralized applications today.

### Overview

Alephium is fully open-source and development happens publicly. Contributions from anyone looking to improve and expand the codebase are welcomed and encouraged. 

Alephium’s full node implementation is written in Scala and has a JS/TS SDK.  \
For smart contract and dApp development, Alephium has its own language called [Ralph](https://wiki.alephium.org/ralph/built-in-functions).
